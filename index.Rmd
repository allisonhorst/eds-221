# Scientific programming essentials for environmental data science

### Material disclaimer and use {.unnumbered}

This book was created by [Allison Horst](www.allisonhorst.com) for EDS 221 (Scientific Programming Essentials) in the Bren School's 1-year [Master of Environmental Data Science program](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) at UC Santa Barbara. It accompanies lecture, computational lab and discussion materials that may or may not be linked to throughout the book. This book is intended as a supplemental resource for some parts of the course. In other words, it is not intended as a standalone textbook.

All materials in this book are openly available for use and reuse by Creative Commons Attribution and Share-Alike license.

### Acknowledgments {.unnumbered}

I create my courses while standing on shoulders of generous teaching and developing giants in R, data science, and education communities. The wealth and quality of open educational resources (OERs) in data science has made teaching in the field fun, innovative, and inspiring. I've tried to thoroughly credit authors resources that I have pulled from and adapted for this book, and I welcome additions if I have missed any that should be included.

That includes leaning heavily on: 

- [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham [@wickham_advanced_2019]
- Introducing Python by Bill Lubanovic [@lubanovic_introducing_2014]

As nicely summarized in the title of a [2018 NCEAS post](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/next-generation-environmental-scientists-are-data-scientists), **"the next generation of environmental scientists are data scientists"**. The explosion in environmental data volume, heterogeneity and availability in recent years has made managing, wrangling, analyzing and communicating with data a critical skill in environmental workplaces. Over the next year in MEDS you'll build skills to responsibly apply advanced methods in environmental modeling, spatial data analysis, machine learning, and more to investigate, analyze and communicate with complex environmental data.

To get there, you'll need a strong foundation in programming basics like: understanding types and structures of data, basic data wrangling and visualization, algorithm development with functions, loops, and conditionals, and how to troubleshoot. While working in the weeds of programming, we'll also learn and reinforce transferable habits for reproducible workflows, robust file paths, version control, data organization, project management, and more.

In EDS 221 you'll also start building versatility by learning fundamental programming skills in different languages (R, Python) and integrated development environments (IDEs) like RStudio and PyCharm, while documenting our work in R Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks.

Upon the building blocks established in EDS 221, you'll be prepared to incrementally grow your advanced environmental data science toolkit throughout MEDS, then enter the workplace at the leading edge of quantitative methods in the field.

## Course setup

In EDS 221 we will write code in R (in scripts and R Markdown) and Python (in scripts and Jupyter Notebooks). You should be set to go if you followed along with the [MEDS Installation Guide]() during orientation.
